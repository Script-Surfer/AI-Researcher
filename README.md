# Topic Research Tool

A minimal AI-powered research assistant built using Next.js (App Router), Vercel AI SDK, and Google Gemini.  
The tool takes a topic as input and generates structured research insights including an overview, key subtopics, important keywords, and research questions.

This project is intentionally kept simple to focus on clean architecture, server-side AI integration, and prompt design.
